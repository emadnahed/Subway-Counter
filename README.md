# Subway-Counter

This project is a simple web page that allows users to increment a counter and save the count to a list. It records the entries of group of people arriving with respect to time and certain interval.  The project consists of three main functions: `increment()`, `save()`, and `reload()`.

## `increment()`

The `increment()` function increases the value of the `count` variable by 1 and updates the text content of the HTML element with the id `count-el` to reflect the new count.

## `save()`

The `save()` function appends the current count to the text content of the HTML element with the id `save-el`, separated by a comma and a space. It then resets the `count` variable to 0 and updates the text content of the `count-el` element to 0.

## `reload()`

The `reload()` function reloads the web page, effectively resetting the counter and the saved counts.

## Usage

To use this project, simply open the HTML file in a web browser and click the "Increment" button to increase the count. Click the "Save" button to save the current count to the list, and click the "Reload" button to reset the counter and the saved counts.
